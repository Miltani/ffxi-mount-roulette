# Final Fantasy XI Mount Roulette

A Lua addon to summon a mount at random for Windower 4. Mimics the FFXIV Mount Roulette function.

## Usage

1. Download and place all files into an addons/MountRoulette directory.
2. Type `//lua load mountroulette` to load Mount Roulette.

### Summon a mount

`//mr`

### Blacklist mounts

You can blacklist certain mounts so Mount Roulette will never choose them.

`//mr blacklist raptor`

## Mount music
In an earlier version, this addon disabled mount music. This is now removed in favour of the MountMuzzle addon, available via Windower.
